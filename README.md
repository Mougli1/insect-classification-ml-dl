# Insect Classification with Classical ML & Deep Learning

Course project for the **AI & Optimization (IG.2411) & Machine Learning (IG.2412)** module (ISEP, 2024–2025). **Grade: 19/20.**

## Summary
Classification of insect species from RGB images using:
- Feature engineering (shape, color statistics, texture/GLCM, histograms) with classical ML (k-NN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Unsupervised baselines (K-Means, Agglomerative)
- A fine-tuned MobileNetV2 CNN

## Data Availability
**Datasets (images) are not included** in this repository due to size constraints. All key **results and figures are available in the report**.
